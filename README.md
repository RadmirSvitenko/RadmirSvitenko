### :man_technologist: About me:

My name is Radmir Svitenko, I am an aspiring Frontend developer. I started to be
interested in the world of IT in 2017, the same year I entered the Kyrgyz
National University in the direction of "Computer Networks and Internet". After
graduating from university, I started working in my specialty, but soon realized
that development attracts me much more, so soon I enrolled in an intensive
course on "Frontend Development". At the moment I am interning in ADA company in
Bishkek and in parallel I am mastering new technologies.
